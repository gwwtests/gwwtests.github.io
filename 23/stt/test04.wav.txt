 okay
 this
 is
 test
 number
 four
 let
's
 record
 something
 longer
 here
 I
 have
 an
 hour
glass
 in
 my
 hand
 I
 really
 like
 hour
gl
asses
 especially
 this
 one
 with
 magnetic
 sound
 it
 makes
 beautiful
 patterns
 when
 magnet
 is
 underneath
 and

 now
 I
 am
 trying
 you
 know
 to
 see
 how
 it
 operates
 when
 it
's
 on
 the
 angle
 and
 how
 the
 sound
 is
 like
 flowing
 in
 this
 magnetic
 field
 and
 creating
 beautiful
 patterns
 such
 a
 nice
 joy
 and
 fun
 to
 watch
 and
 to
 play
 with
 it
 especially
 in

 breaks
 from
 work
 to
 enjoy
 to
 recharge
 to
 slow
 down
 but
 at
 the
 same
 time
 have
 a
 bit
 more
 sense
 of
 time
 also
 to
 appreciate
 how
 much
 joy
 can
 give
 this
 one
 to
 two
 and
 a
 half
 minutes
 how
 much
 it
 can
 be
 because
 this
 how
 long
 it
 takes

 for
 this
 small
 hour
glass
 to
 go
 through
 the
 sand
